# Octo Dark Cyber Squad PHP Injector Tool



## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

The **Octo Dark Cyber Squad PHP Injector Tool** allows security testers and researchers to stealthily embed PHP payloads into JPEG image metadata. This can be used for advanced authorized penetration testing and security research.

Inject PHP webshells or arbitrary PHP code into multiple JPEG metadata fields, including EXIF, IPTC, and XMP ‚Äî enabling covert payload delivery in environments that rely on image uploads.
